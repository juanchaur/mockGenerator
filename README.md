#MockGenerator

**MockGenerator** is a Desktop/terminal tool to create Mocks on the fly. It allows you to create templates and mock users.

What's behind it:
 * Node-Webkit
 * AngularJS
 * GruntJS

In order to set up everything run: ```./config.sh```

In order to run it from **CentOS 6** you just need to run in your terminal: ```./runner.sh```

For other OS, you need to have installed *node-webkit* and run ```nw mockGenerator```
